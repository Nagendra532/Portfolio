The plan
Build a website with HTML and CSS an a bit of Javascript. For the JS part I am thinking of building a simple darkmode.

The website wil contain:

a header with My name in it , a menu with links to various parts of my portfolio.
a main section with information about me, a picture of me, a list with projects I have done, My skills and languages.
a small footer
a simple contact page
For the layout I'll use the same layout as Codecademy's sample project for now.

Plan your project (6/6/2021)
For me this is the hardest to do, because I am not well at planning. I am going to spend a week to do each step and i'll adjust the plan if needed. Except for this stem. Today I have written down my plans in this README file and created a repository on GitHub , so that I can keep all the info on GitHub.

Wireframe your website (start 7/6/2021)
I would like to use Adobe XD to Wireframe my website. If this does not work, i'll use paper and a pencil. I am reading and using a Tutorial about Adobe XD to learn more about Adobe XD and make the wireframe.

I made a Wireframe in Adobe XD, but I still don't know how it works. Elements I made are suddenly removed or there are duplicate elements, but it's pretty hard. I made a wireframe for the homepage. it's almost finished and after that, I'll make one for the contactpage. If it doesn't work out, I'll use pen and paper.

I made a somewhat fancy Wireframe in Adobe XD. It's not a perfect Wireframe but it does the job. The images are too large, but that's ok.
